## Unit 1 Frontend Foundations, Career Simulation: Personal Website Pt II

What are we trying to make?
Previously in this unit, you created a personal website. Now there is more to add:
An email from calliope reading

"Our design and executive teams have requested that everybody use CSS grid or flex, proportional units, and some more advanced styling to show off our abilities, and also include a new page with a contact form (we will provide a URL for the submission).

Grab a partner within your dev team, and work with each other to develop a plan to enhance each of your personal sites, along with tickets in Github Projects for each task that needs to be completed.

Please make all code changes in the same Github repository as your original site in new branches, submit pull requests, and have your partner review and approve each task as it's completed. Submit your Github repository link when you're finished; as always, don't hesitate to reach out if you need more info!". 

Instructions
All the previous pages should be in this assessment.
